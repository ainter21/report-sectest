## True Positives

- **xss_dashboard.php_10_min** outputs the username in the orders table. If the username is a HTML formatted string, it will be printed as it is without controls, so it can be used insert malicious code. The **User Wise Order** is only seen by the admin.
  - **Attack vector**: change the username from user setting with HTML code
  - **Fix**: output the username after it has been sanitized with `htmlentities($orderResult['username'])`
- **xss_fetchBrand.php_1_min** outputs the brand name, the availability and a button to edit or remove it. It is a xss vulnerability because the brand name with HTML malicious code.
  - **Attack vector**: create a brand with this name `<h1>Malicious</h1>`. It will be formatted as an `<h1>` item.
  - **Fix**: sanitize the name of the brand with `htmlentities`.
## False Positives

- **xss_dashboard.php_3_min**: the echo function prints out the number of rows returned by the SQL query. There is no user input printed because this number is calculated by `mysqli_num_rows()` function. 
- **xss_dashboard.php_4_min**: the echo function prints out the number of rows returned by the SQL query, using `mysqli_num_rows()`.
- **xss_dashboard.php_5_min**: the echo function prints out the number of rows returned by the SQL query, using `mysqli_num_rows()`
- **xss_dashboard.php_11_min**: there is no way to exploit the total order amount to inject some malicious code. If you try to add a new product with amount that has html code in it, and then you try to create an order from it, you won't be able to see this order anywhere after it has been created (probably because the amount during the creation is set  to `Nan`). 
- **xss_index.php_2_min**: `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` is set up from the webserver, and no user input is printed out.
- **xss_createBrand.php_1_min**: `echo json_encode($valid);` outputs a string not written by the user that asserts that the query has been succesful.
- **xss_removeBrand.php_1_min**: `echo json_encode($valid);` outputs a strig that states the result status of an execution of a query. This string is not written by the user.
- **xss_editBrand.php_1_min**: the echo funtion outputs a string not written by the user.
